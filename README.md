## Architecture Diagram

### Explanation of Diagram
- We use 2 availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance
- EC2 instances are protected in the private subnets and can be accessed via the NAT gateways for protected internet connection
- User requests and responses follow the internet gateway, to the ALB, to the instances, and the master DB and back.
- We have 1 master DB and 1 standby DB, the master DB handles all main operations while the standby is synchronized.

## Project Setup
### 1. Set up the VPC
  - Go to the AWS console and create a VPC
  - Use all default settings for "VPC only" but add a name tag (mine is MyVPC) and change the IPV4 CIDR to 10.0.0.0/16
### 2. Set up an Internet Gateway
  - Go to the Internet gateway section and create an Internet gateway
  - Add a name tag (mine is myInternetGateway)
  - After it is created, select it, go to the "Actions" dropdown select "Attach to VPC" and attach it to the VPC we just made
